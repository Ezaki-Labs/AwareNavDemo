# 🎮 AwareNav Demo

This project demonstrates two experimental AI navigation systems of AwareNav plugin:
- **Permission-based AI navigation** through disguises (*Agent 74*)
- **Emotion-driven behavior and memory-based navigation** (*Hungry Fox*)

👉 This demo is powered by the [AwareNav Plugin](https://github.com/eduardzakaryan90/AwareNav).

## 🕵️‍♂️ Agent 74 — Permission System Demo

> *Stealth-based gameplay with dynamic access control*

You play as **Agent 74**, tasked with eliminating a high-value target.

- Disguises grant access to otherwise restricted zones.
- Enemies have line-of-sight detection.
- A silent takedown system discourages getting spotted.

## 🦊 Hungry Fox — Emotions System Demo

> *Emotion-based pathfinding and memory-driven NPC reactions*

You control a fox hunting animals in a living ecosystem where NPCs react emotionally to past events and danger zones.

- Rabbits (blue) and Chickens (yellow) behave differently:
  - Rabbits **remember** past dangers and avoid "haunted" areas.
  - Chickens do **not remember**, so they don't react on memory based zones.
- Each kill creates a **fear zone**, dynamically influencing nearby animals.
- Animals seek **safe zones** which the fox **cannot enter**.

## 🔧 Features Demonstrated

- Custom AI Navigation Filters
- Permission-level logic using disguises
- Emotion-based heatmap navigation (fear, memory, safety)
- Dynamic area influence (e.g. fear zones after kills)
- NPC behavioral variation based on emotion profiles

## ❗Disclaimer

This is not a full game — it is a demo project built to showcase the capabilities of the **AwareNav** plugin for Unreal Engine.

## 🧠 Inspired By

- *Hitman* (stealth + disguise mechanics)
- *The Last Guardian* / *Rain World* (emotion-based AI behavior)
- Research into emotion-driven navigation and memory-based planning
